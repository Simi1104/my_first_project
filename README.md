# Video Game Success Prediction 🎮

This project focuses on predicting the success of video games using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to analyze various features related to video games and determine whether a game is likely to be successful.

## 📌 Project Objective
To build a simple AI/ML model that predicts video game success based on available game-related attributes such as sales, ratings, or other relevant factors.

## 🧠 Methodology
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Model training and testing
- Performance evaluation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📂 Files in This Repository
- `AI_Project.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the project
- `video_games.csv` : Dataset used for training and testing the model
